  p The new 2017 redesigned Cryometrix T-160 programmable ULT freezer delivers on all points. The T-160 freezer is a technological breakthrough that incorporates a compressor-free, redundant, liquid nitrogen-based technology. The T-160 is a stable, scalable, adaptable, and validatable platform. The payload capacity is 33.5 ft<sup>3</sup> (950 L = 72,000 2-mL vials), and with its all stainless steel upright design, the T-160 addresses several user issues such as security, ease of operation, cleaning, and the system is designed to eliminate icing.
