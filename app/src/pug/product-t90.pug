  p The new completely redesigned Cryometrix T-90 programmable storage freezer delivers on all points. The T-90 freezer is a technological breakthrough that incorporates a compressor-free, redundant, liquid nitrogen-based technology with an upright design. You can now reach temperatures down to -90Â°C in a fraction of the time that traditional mechanical freezer would take. And dont worry about the door open recovery, the T-90 can recover temperature from a typical door open in less than 15 minutes. The T-90 is a stable, scalable, adaptable, and validatable platform. The payload capacity is 33.5 ft3 (950 L = 72,000 2-mL vials), and with its all stainless steel upright design, the T-90 addresses several user issues such as security, ease of operation, cleaning, and the system is designed to eliminate icing.
