  p Cryometrix is proud to announce the newest freezer to their lineup, the S-90 Shipper. We have taken everything that you love about the T-90 storage freezer and incorporated an onboard LN2 supply and power supply so that the freezer can be shipped across the world or accross your campus. The onboard LN2 supply and batteries will allow the freezer to run on its own for 15 days at -80Â°C.
